  _introText: "It is a tale that my father, Ashita Dick - the lengedary treasure
    hunter, told me about when I was just three years old.\r\n\r\nAccording to him,
    once there lived a fearsome pirate by the name of Captain Bone Herr...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe
    is said to have amass a lot of wealth from his pirate hunting adventures on places
    like Big Booty Island, Small Booty Island, and Medium Booty Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it is said that after amassing so much wealth he retired and retreated to an
    island and hid it somewhere on a cave underneath the sea under its shore. If
    that sounds like a grammatical and comprehensive nightmare, then I must inform
    you that those are not my words, but of my father. He never passed fifth standard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    after he hid his treasure in the cave, he is said to have befriended a mystical
    octopus on their common love for the superhero comic series, Lap Dance, written
    by Bone Herr's late mother S. Tripp Herr. After Bone Herr died, it is said that
    the mystical Octopus took on the role of the guardian of his treasure and in
    doing so; mind controlled every sea and land creature nearby. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
    they have been a pain in my pincers. You see, I, Anita Dick...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaughter
    of legendary treasure hunter Ashita Dick and granddaughter of legendary milkman
    Alita Dick... never actually wanted to be a treasure hunter and never did wish
    to hunt for Bone Herr's treasure, but apparently Creative Writing courses...
    DOESN'T PROVIDE YOU WITH ENOUGH JOB OPPURTUNITIES TO PAY OFF YOUR STUDENT LOAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo,
    after grabbing my late father's (he died while smoking Sea Weed by slipping on
    a banana and falling from the ledge of Grand Booty Canyon) research from his
    bank locker, I set on an adventure and I have been...\r\n\r\nStabbed.\r\n\r\nPinched.\r\n\r\nShot.\r\n\r\nBurned.\r\n\r\nTortured.\r\n\r\nDrowned.\r\n\r\nAnd
    most horrifying of them all,\r\n\r\nSpanked.\r\n\r\nThroughout this unnatural
    expedition.\r\n\r\nI thought once I would reach the shores of E. Rex Sean beach,
    the journey to the shore of Bone Herr's cave would be piece of...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n...shit...
    they are bloody strong and... and...\r\n\r\nThey look lifeless to me in their
    eyes, as if they have no soul.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut....\r\n\r\n\r\n...I am the same
    way when I see my ever piling student debt.\r\n\r\nWHY DID I THINK CREATIVE WRITING
    WOULD BE A GREAT DEGREE\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am very close to my goal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd
    nobody can stop me from reaching it."
  _level1Text: "What I found was not the treasure but a fake chest made to fool many
    people... but it couldn't fool me. I knew, thanks to my father's research, that
    the real treasure was inside a cave. However, this chest still had little bit
    of treasure in it that unfortunately was not enough to pay my student loan. It
    wasn't even enough to pay for my morning starfish coffee.\r\n\r\nI knew I needed
    to go forward... under the sea.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I first entered the Big Sea
    (Oh lord it was big), I saw that the mind controlled puffer fishes were repeating
    a name again and again...\r\n\r\n\"Clee-torus, Clee-torus,\" was the name they
    were repeating.\r\n\r\nIf my knowledge of Bone Herr's tale was correct, it was
    the name of the octopus. \r\n\r\nA mighty octopus that is said to be dangerous,
    huge, and mighty.\r\n\r\nMy crabby legs are shaking in fear of his image as I
    write this... on my Blackberry mobile.\r\n\r\nI cannot wonder what horrors he
    may present to me, but still...\r\n\r\nI. SHOULD. MOVE. FORWARD.\r\n\r\nFor not
    matter how strong he maybe, he is not stronger than my student loan. Upon whose
    name, I still lose sanity and feel my body fall into the darkening and spiraling
    nothingness."
  _level2Text: "ANOTHER FAKE TREASURE.\r\n\r\nIt was as if I was in a badly made
    Game Jam game, where the developers didn't have enough time to finish a smoother
    level transition that they had initially planned and so they planted these shitty
    chests to mark the end of the level.\r\n\r\nIt was as if, they had brought back
    the talentless writer of this tale to add some \"inbetween text\" so they could
    mask for the fact that they had overly estimated their capabilities in how many
    levels they can make in just ten days.\r\n\r\nIt was clear to me that usage of
    fourth wall breaking unfunny comedic writing was utilized to give this tale a
    sense of charm that it inherently didn't posses and never will...\r\n\r\nBut
    it was all just hypothetical.\r\n\r\nThe \"Truman Show Effect\" if you may.\r\n\r\nLike,
    wondering if your life was just a 4 palette colored world controlled by some
    loser from his keyboard who can't get over his nostalgia for GameBoy games, not
    realizing that some of the biggest atrocities committed in gaming histories like
    Castlevania The Adventure or Mortal Kombat II's GameBoy port were produced for
    this system. It truly was, if nostalgia may not bind the eyes of the dreamingly
    inept pieces of human feces with sugar coated blindfolds, the worst Nintendo
    handheld of all time...which was only good for playing Tetris.\r\n\r\nBut that
    was all hypothetical questioning that I brought in my mind because of the second
    similar looking fake treasure that I so conveniently found.\r\n\r\nYou see, the
    crab brain is capable of thinking certain inter-dimensional possibilities because
    it is known to every species that they would eventually evolve into us.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    after twelve hours, twelve minutes, and thirteen seconds, I found myself deeper
    into the underwater area and saw an opening.\r\n\r\nI swam up this opening to
    find a rocky place.\r\n\r\nThough, it was dripping with water trinklets here
    and there, it was devoid of any drowning water.\r\n\r\nI was back into dry rocky
    land or more clearly...\r\n\r\nIn a cave\r\n\r\nHa. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
    Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.\r\n  Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.\r\nHa. Ha.
    Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.\r\n  Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
    Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.\r\nHa. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.\r\n  Ha. Ha.
    Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.\r\n  \r\nAs I write this on Blackberry
    mobile, I realize that I have finally reached the cave where Bone Herr hid his
    treasure.\r\n\r\nHis dripping booty cave, if you may.\r\n\r\nDripping with water
    trinklets.\r\n\r\nDripping with gold.\r\n\r\nDripping with maddening rocky structure.\r\n\r\nDripping
    as it may mould.\r\n\r\nI AM HERE\r\n\r\nI AM HERE\r\n\r\nAnd though temporarily,
    I seem to have lost sanity and embraced insanity by grabbing on to it with tightening
    pincers that pierce through the skin of the weak, I know that soon enough...\r\n\r\nI
    will be whole again...\r\n\r\nI will be sane again...\r\n\r\nI will be back to
    being a normal crab...\r\n\r\nBut that would only happen...\r\n\r\nIf I defeat
    that legendary Octopus and taken the shiny treasure of Bone Herr.\r\n\r\nOh I
    can smell the real treasure...the treasure that will abolish my student loan.\r\n\r\nOh
    Oh Oh\r\n\r\nTableu...Tableu....I feel Blue,\r\n\r\nThe treasure is somewhere
    close, \r\n\r\nThe octopus named Clee-torus, will wish that he knew."
  _level3Text: "The treasure was shiny... really, really, shiny. And I stood there,
    laughing at my victory on the great mighty octopus \r\n(offscreen... because
    it was too epic for your mortal eyes to handle)\r\nupon the fact that my student
    loan, after a long painful journey, was finally repayed.\r\n\r\nCarrying the
    treasure one by one, I managed to escape with the gold.\r\n\r\nSoon I became
    a celebrity.\r\n\r\nI Partied.\r\n\r\nI drank.\r\n\r\nI partied.\r\n\r\nI drank.\r\n\r\nI
    even had a three-way wrestling match with a female Pufferfish and a male Mantis
    Shrimp.\r\n\r\nKind of...\r\n\r\nYou see...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experience was so
    explosive that the Pufferfish exploded upon her first scream in the first four
    seconds.\r\n\r\nAfter which the male Mantis Shrimp only lasted sixty-eight seconds
    after that. He was soon branded a disappointment by his species for missing a
    great, GREAT, opportunity by not lasting one more second.\r\n\r\nHe was hanged
    in the middle of the street and his dead body was stoned brutally.\r\n\r\nWith
    that said...\r\n\r\nMy success didn't last long.\r\n\r\nAfter I used my money
    to pay off my student loan, I came to a realization that...\r\n\r\nADVENTURES
    ARE EXPENSIVE MAN\r\n\r\nLike, you have to pay for\r\n\r\nTravel Cost\r\n\r\nEquipment
    Cost\r\n\r\nMedical Cost\r\n\r\nWeapon Cost\r\n\r\nBribery Cost (to get information)\r\n\r\nCarrying
    Cost (to bring back the treasure)\r\n\r\nSecurity Cost (To secure the treasure)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAND
    SO...I found myself in debt again.\r\n\r\nIn depression of said 'new' debt, I
    ended up drinking too much...\r\n\r\nWait...\r\n\r\nBEVERAGE AND FOOD COST\r\n\r\nHOW
    COULD I HAVE FORGOTTEN BEVERAGE AND FOOD COST\r\n\r\nHOLY CRAB WAS I AN IDIOT
    TO EMBARK ON THIS CRABBY EXPLORATION\r\n\r\nAnyway, so yeah, I ended up drinking
    too much and accidentally got into a bar fight with a poorly drawn panda. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow,
    I am in jail. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd it seems like that...\r\n\r\n...escaping
    from this jail, would be an adventure of its own.\r\n\r\nHOPEFULLY A LESS COSTLY
    ONE.\r\n\r\nSo till we meet again...\r\n\r\nWhen I hopefully escape this prison
    called by many inmates as \"The Devil's Hole\".\r\n\r\nThis is Anita Dick...
    \r\nmother's name - Agreta Dick,\r\ngrandmother's name - Amovin Dick...\r\ndaughter
    of famous explorer Ashita Dick and famous milkman Alita Dick...\r\n\r\nsigning
    off....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMING SOON...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnita
    Dick In\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Devil's Hole, A Crabby Escape\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause to get
