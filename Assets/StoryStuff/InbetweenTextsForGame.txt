It is a tale that my father, Ashita Dick - the lengedary treasure hunter, told me about when I was just three years old. 
According to him, once there lived a fearsome pirate by the name of Captain Bone Herr...



He is said to have amass a lot of wealth from his pirate hunting adventures on places like Big Booty Island, Small Booty Island, and Medium Booty Island.



However, it is said that after amassing so much wealth he retreated to an island and hid it somewhere on a cave underneath the sea under its shore. If that sounds like a grammatical and comprehensive nightmare, then I must inform you that those are not my words, but of my father. He never passed fifth standard.



Anyway, after he hid his treasure in the cave, he is said to have befriended a mystical octopus on their common love for the superhero comic series, Lap Dance, written by Bone Herr's late mother Strip Herr. After Bone Herr died, it is said that the mystical Octopus took on the role of the guardian of treasure and in doing so, mind controlled every sea and land creature nearby.



And they have been a pain in my pincers. You see, I, Anita Dick...



Daughter of legendary treasure hunter Ashita Dick and granddaughter of legendary milkman Alita Dick.... never actually wanted to be a treasure hunter hunting Bone Herr's treasure, but apparently Creative Writing courses....DOESN'T PROVIDE YOU WITH ENOUGH JOB OPPURTUNITIES TO PAY OF YOUR STUDENT LOAN.



So, after grabbing my late father's research from (he died while smoking Sea Weed by slipping on a banana and falling from the ledge of Grand Booty Canyon) from his bank locker, I set on an adventure and I have been...

Stabbed.

Pinched.

Shot.

Burned.

Tortured.

Drowned.

And most horrifying of them all,

Spanked.

Throughout this adventure.

I thought once I would reach the shores of E. Rex Sean beach, the journey to the shore of Bone Herr's cave would be piece of...



...holy crab, they be strong. The mind controlled creatures, unlike me, are devoid of any skin color. It is as if their body is not their own, and neither is their soul. But then...

...I am the same way when I see my ever piling student loan.

WHY DID I THINK CREATIVE WRITING WOULD BE A GREAT DEGREE!

  Anyway, I am very close to my goal.



And nobody can stop me from reaching it.



For I am...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What I found was not the treasure but a fake chest made to fool many people... but it couldn't fool me. I knew, thanks to my father's research, that the real treasure was inside a cave. However, this chest still had little bit of treasure in it that unfortunately was not enough to pay my student loan. It wasn't even enough to pay for my morning starfish coffee.

I knew I needed to go forward... under the sea.

As soon as I first entered the Big Sea (Oh lord it was big), I saw that the mind controlled puffer fishes were repeating a name again and again...

"Clee-torus, Clee-torus," was the name they were repeating.

If my knowledge of Bone Herr's tale was correct, it was the name of the octopus. 

A mighty octopus that is said to be dangerous, huge, and mighty.

My crabby legs are shaking in fear of his image as I write this... on my Blackberry mobile.

I cannot wonder what horrors he may present to me, but still...

I. SHOULD. MOVE. FORWARD.

For not matter how strong he maybe, he is not stronger than my student loan. Upon whose name, I still lose sanity and feel my body fall into the darkening and spiraling nothingness.

ANOTHER FAKE TREASURE.

It was as if I was in a badly made Game Jam game, where the developers didn't have enough time to finish a smoother level transition that they had initially planned and so they planted these shitty chests to mark the end of the level.

It was as if, they had brought back the talentless writer of this tale to add some "inbetween text" so they could mask for the fact that they had overly estimated their capabilities in how many levels they can make in just ten days.

It was clear to me that usage of fourth wall breaking unfunny comedic writing was utilized to give this tale a sense of charm that it inherently didn't posses and never will...

But it was all just hypothetical.

The "Truman Show Effect" if you may.

Like, wondering if your life was just a 4 palette colored world controlled by some loser from his keyboard who can't get over his nostalgia for GameBoy games, not realizing that some of the biggest atrocities committed in gaming histories like Castlevania The Adventure or Mortal Kombat II's GameBoy port were produced for this system. It truly was, if nostalgia may not bind the eyes of the dreamingly inept pieces of human feces with sugar coated blindfolds, the worst Nintendo handheld of all time...which was only good for playing Tetris.

But that was all hypothetical questioning that I brought in my mind because of the second similar looking fake treasure that I so conveniently found.

You see, the crab brain is capable of thinking certain inter-dimensional possibilities because it is known to every species that they would eventually evolve into us.

Anyway, after twelve hours, twelve minutes, and thirteen seconds, I found myself deeper into the underwater area and saw an opening.

I swam up this opening to find a rocky place.

Though, it was dripping with water trinklets here and there, it was devoid of any drowning water.

I was back into dry rocky land or more clearly...

In a cave!

Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
  Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
  Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
  Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.
  
As I write this on Blackberry mobile, I realize that I have finally reached the cave where Bone Herr hid his treasure.

His dripping booty cave, if you may.

Dripping with water trinklets.

Dripping with gold.

Dripping with maddening rocky structure.

Dripping as it may mould.

I AM HERE!

I AM HERE!

And though temporarily, I seem to have lost sanity and embraced insanity by grabbing on to it with tightening pincers that pierce through the skin of the weak, I know that soon enough...

I will be whole again...

I will be sane again...

I will be back to being a normal crab...

But that would only happen...

If I defeat that legendary Octopus and taken the shiny treasure of Bone Herr.

Oh! I can smell the real treasure...the treasure that will abolish my student loan.

Oh! Oh! Oh!

Tableu...Tableu....I feel Blue,

The treasure is somewhere close, 

The octopus named Clee-torus, will wish that he knew.
